## 4. GEOGRAPHIC OVERLAP STRATEGY

### 4.1 Overlapping Suburbs Analysis

#### Browns Plains
**Overlap:** Could fit South Brisbane OR Logan microsite
**Data:** 30 searches @ $12.15 CPC
**Recommendation:** Assign to **South Brisbane** microsite
**Rationale:**
- Geographically closer to Sunnybank/south suburbs
- Logan microsite not recommended due to low volume
- Better to have one strong South Brisbane site than two weak sites

#### Capalaba
**Overlap:** Could fit South Brisbane OR East Brisbane
**Data:** ~30 searches
**Recommendation:** Assign to **East Brisbane** microsite
**Rationale:**
- Geographically on eastern side (bayside corridor)
- Better geographic coherence with Wynnum/Redland Bay
- Mention in South Brisbane site but don't create dedicated page

#### Milton
**Overlap:** Could fit Central Brisbane OR West Brisbane
**Data:** 70 searches @ $11.13 CPC
**Recommendation:** Assign to **Central Brisbane** microsite
**Rationale:**
- Inner-city suburb, closer to CBD
- Premium suburb fits Central Brisbane demographic
- West Brisbane focuses on Ipswich/Springfield growth corridor

#### Toowong
**Overlap:** Could fit Central Brisbane OR West Brisbane
**Data:** 20 searches @ $17.10 CPC
**Recommendation:** Assign to **West Brisbane** microsite
**Rationale:**
- Gateway to western suburbs
- Balances West Brisbane content (currently Ipswich-heavy)
- Central Brisbane already has sufficient premium suburbs

#### Redcliffe
**Overlap:** Could fit North Brisbane OR potential Peninsula microsite
**Data:** 50 searches @ $25.12 CPC
**Recommendation:** Assign to **North Brisbane** microsite
**Rationale:**
- Not enough Peninsula volume for dedicated site
- North Brisbane microsite covers northern corridor
- Strong CPC justifies inclusion

---

### 4.2 Cross-Linking Strategy

**Internal Linking Between Microsites:**

1. **Geographic Boundaries Messaging:**
   - Each microsite clearly states coverage area on homepage
   - "We service North Brisbane including..." with list
   - Link to other microsites: "For Gold Coast mortgage brokers, visit our Gold Coast site"

2. **Suburb Overlap Handling:**
   - Primary assignment gets dedicated page
   - Secondary mention gets brief paragraph + link
   - Example: Browns Plains gets full page on South Brisbane site, brief mention on Logan (if created) with link to South Brisbane

3. **Service Page Cross-Linking:**
   - Each service page (e.g., "First Home Buyers") has location-specific content
   - Footer links to same service on other microsite
   - Example: "First Home Buyers North Brisbane" links to "First Home Buyers Gold Coast"

4. **Blog Strategy:**
   - Central Brisbane blog becomes "flagship" covering all Queensland
   - Regional microsites have local market update blogs
   - Cross-promote: "See also: Brisbane property market update"

5. **SEO Implications:**
   - Each microsite is separate domain/subdomain (avoids duplicate content)
   - Schema markup indicates "areaServed" for each geographic region
   - Google Business Profile for each region (if broker has physical presence)

---

### 4.3 Domain Strategy

**Recommended Approach:** Separate Domains

**Option A: Separate Branded Domains (RECOMMENDED)**
```
goldcoastmortgagebroker.com.au
northbrisbanemortgagebroker.com.au
brisbanemortgagebroker.com.au
ipswich-mortgage-broker.com.au
toowoomba-mortgage-broker.com.au
```

**Advantages:**
- Clean geographic separation
- Better local SEO signals
- Can sell individual sites if needed
- Clearer brand positioning per region
- Separate Google Business Profiles

**Disadvantages:**
- More domains to manage
- Separate DA/authority building per site
- Higher hosting costs

**Option B: Subdomain Strategy**
```
goldcoast.mainbrand.com.au
northbrisbane.mainbrand.com.au
brisbane.mainbrand.com.au
ipswich.mainbrand.com.au
```

**Advantages:**
- Builds authority on one main domain
- Easier brand management
- Lower hosting costs
- Centralized analytics

**Disadvantages:**
- Less geographic independence
- Harder to sell individual sites
- Potential geographic confusion

**FINAL RECOMMENDATION:**
- **Separate domains for Phase 1 sites** (Gold Coast, North Brisbane, Brisbane City)
- **Subdomains for Phase 2/3** (leverage authority from Phase 1 success)
- All domains point to same company, just different geographic brands

---

#### PAID ADVERTISING STRATEGY

**1. Phase 1: Support SEO with Targeted PPC**
- Don't compete on generic "mortgage broker brisbane" ($27 CPC)
- Target suburb-specific long-tail keywords
- Example: "mortgage broker for first home buyers north lakes"
- Lower CPCs, higher conversion, supports SEO testing

**2. Refinancing Campaign Priority**
- Highest CPCs ($42-48) indicate strong market demand
- Lower competition (people aren't bidding as much as new purchases)
- **Budget allocation:** 40% refinancing, 30% first home buyers, 30% other

**3. Geographic Targeting**
- Gold Coast: Radius targeting around Southport, Robina, Burleigh
- North Brisbane: Radius targeting around Chermside, North Lakes
- Brisbane City: CBD + 10km radius

**4. Retargeting Strategy**

---

#### BUSINESS STRATEGY

**1. Physical Presence Matters**
- Google favors businesses with physical addresses in service areas
- **Recommendation:**
  - Gold Coast office (highest value market)
  - North Brisbane meeting space (serviced office/coworking)
  - Brisbane CBD office (brand credibility)
- Can use serviced offices for GMB verification

**2. Review Generation System**
- Google reviews crucial for local SEO
- Target: 50+ reviews per major location (Gold Coast, Brisbane)
- Request reviews post-settlement
- Incentivize with referral program (not for review, for referral)

**3. Partnership Strategy**
- Real estate agents in target suburbs
- Accountants (for self-employed clients, doctor clients)
- Financial planners (wealth building, investment properties)
- Builders (construction loans)

**4. Lead Nurturing**
- Many searches are informational ("how to", "what is")
- Build email list with free guides:
  - "First Home Buyer Guide - Gold Coast 2025"
  - "Investment Property Hotspots - North Brisbane"
  - "Refinancing Calculator & Guide"
- Nurture with suburb market updates

---

### 7.3 Keyword Categories NOT to Target (Out of Scope)

Based on analysis, **EXCLUDE** these keyword types (too broad, not mortgage-focused):

**General Finance Broker:**
- "finance broker brisbane" - 390 searches @ $25.24
- "finance broker" - 5,400 searches @ $28.54
- **Reason:** Too broad, includes car finance, equipment finance, personal loans

**Car Finance:**
- "car finance broker brisbane" - 90 searches @ $24.32
- "car loan broker" - numerous variants
- **Reason:** Different business model, not mortgage-specific

**Business Finance:**
- "business finance broker brisbane" - 50 searches
- "business loan broker" - various
- **Reason:** Different expertise, different lender panel

**Equipment/Asset Finance:**
- "equipment finance broker" - 720 searches
- "asset finance broker" - 480 searches
- **Reason:** Commercial specialty, not residential mortgage

**Personal Loans:**
- "personal loan broker" - various
- **Reason:** Unsecured lending, different service

**Insurance Broking:**
- "insurance broker brisbane" - 1,600 searches
- **Reason:** Completely different industry

**STICK TO:** Residential mortgages, investment property loans, refinancing, construction loans (residential), commercial property loans (if client offers). This maintains narrow focus and service expertise.
