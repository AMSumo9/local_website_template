## Tier 4: LOW Video Opportunities ⚠️
### Local Commercial Intent = No Video Results Expected

These keywords are unlikely to show video results in Google search because they have strong **local commercial intent** - users want to find local businesses/services, not watch videos.

### 10-15. Local Keywords (LOW Video Opportunity)
- ❌ "mortgage broker bendigo" (320/month) - Local business search
- ❌ "home loans bendigo" (180/month) - Local service search
- ❌ "bendigo mortgage broker" (140/month) - Local business search
- ❌ "mortgage broker eaglehawk" (45/month) - Local business search
- ❌ "home loans eaglehawk" (25/month) - Local service search
- ❌ "mortgage broker golden square" (30/month) - Local business search

**Why Videos Don't Rank:**
These queries trigger the "Local Pack" (map + 3 businesses) in Google search results. Users want:
- Phone numbers
- Addresses
- Reviews
- Business hours
- Direct contact

**Video Strategy for These Keywords:**
While videos won't rank in traditional search, they CAN be valuable for:
1. **Google Business Profile** - Add videos to your GBP listing
2. **Website Conversion** - Embed on location pages to increase trust
3. **Social Media** - Share on Facebook/Instagram for local targeting
4. **Remarketing** - Show to people who've visited your site

**Recommended Supporting Videos:**
- "Meet the Team: Bendigo Mortgage Brokers"
- "Our Office Tour: Located in Bendigo CBD"
- "Client Success Stories: Bendigo Home Buyers"

**Ease of Ranking in Main Search:** ⭐ (1/5)
- Not expected to show video results

---
