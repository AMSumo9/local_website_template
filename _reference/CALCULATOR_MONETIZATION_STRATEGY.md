## Revenue Model Overview

### Three Primary Revenue Streams

#### 1. Direct SEO/Lead Generation (Own Sites)
**How It Works:**
- Deploy calculators on your local business sites
- Capture organic traffic for calculator keywords
- Convert visitors to leads/customers

**Revenue:**
- Service revenue from leads generated
- Increased site authority and rankings
- Cross-sell opportunities

**Example:**
- Mortgage calculator on mortgage broker site
- Generates 100 leads/month @ $500 average value = $50,000/mo revenue

**Timeline:** Immediate (0-3 months to see results)

---

#### 2. Calculator Aggregation Site (Advertising + Affiliates)
**How It Works:**
- Build standalone calculator website
- Attract traffic through SEO
- Monetize through ads and affiliate commissions

**Revenue Sources:**
- Display advertising (AdSense, Mediavine, etc.)
- Affiliate commissions (insurance, loans, services)
- Sponsored calculators
- Lead generation (selling leads to businesses)

**Example Revenue:**
- 100,000 monthly visitors
- Ad RPM of $10 = $1,000/mo (ads)
- Affiliate conversions: 500 clicks @ 2% conversion @ $50 commission = $500/mo
- Total: $1,500/mo growing to $10,000+/mo at scale

**Timeline:** 6-12 months to profitability

---

#### 3. SaaS/White-Label Product (Subscription Revenue)
**How It Works:**
- Build embeddable calculator widgets
- Sell subscriptions to businesses
- Provide white-label versions

**Revenue:**
- Monthly recurring revenue (MRR)
- Setup fees
- Custom development projects
- Enterprise licenses

**Example Revenue:**
- 50 customers @ $99/mo average = $4,950/mo MRR
- $59,400/year recurring revenue
- 10% monthly growth = $115,000+ year 2

**Timeline:** 3-6 months to first revenue, 12-18 months to scale

## Monetization Methods Detailed

### Method 1: Display Advertising

**Platforms:**
1. **Google AdSense** (easiest to start)
   - Requirements: None (anyone can apply)
   - RPM: $2-5 (low quality)
   - Payment: Monthly, $100 minimum
   - Best For: New sites with <50K visitors/month

2. **Mediavine** (recommended for growth)
   - Requirements: 50,000 sessions/month
   - RPM: $15-30 (high quality)
   - Payment: NET 65
   - Best For: Established sites with quality traffic

   - Requirements: 100,000 pageviews/month
   - RPM: $20-40 (premium)

**Revenue Calculation:**
```
Traffic × Pages/Session × Ad RPM / 1000 = Monthly Revenue

Example (Mediavine):

```

**Optimization Tips:**
