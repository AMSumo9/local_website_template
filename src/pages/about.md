## Your Trusted North Brisbane Mortgage Experts

Welcome to North Brisbane Mortgage Brokers. We are a locally-based team of dedicated mortgage professionals with a single goal: to help North Brisbane families and investors achieve their property ownership dreams.

Our principal broker, **Sarah Thompson**, has over 15 years of experience in the finance industry, specializing in the North Brisbane property market. She is a fully licensed professional and a true local specialist who understands the unique opportunities across North Lakes, Chermside, Aspley, and all surrounding suburbs.

### Why Choose a Local North Brisbane Broker?

Unlike big banks that only offer their own products, we work for you, not the lenders. We get to know your personal situation and then leverage our access to 50+ lenders to find the right loan for your specific needs.

**15+ Years Experience:** We've helped hundreds of North Brisbane families navigate first home purchases, refinancing, investment properties, and complex lending scenarios.

**Local North Brisbane Specialist:** We understand the North Brisbane property market inside and out—from the master-planned community of North Lakes to the established charm of Chermside, the growth corridors of Mango Hill and Caboolture, and the beachside appeal of Redcliffe.

**MFAA Approved:** We adhere to the highest standards of ethics and professional conduct set by the Mortgage & Finance Association of Australia.

**No Broker Fees:** Our service is typically free for residential home loans. We're paid by lenders after settlement, meaning you get expert advice, application management, and ongoing support without upfront costs.

### Our North Brisbane Commitment

We live and work in North Brisbane. When you work with us, you're working with someone who:
- Knows which lenders prefer which North Brisbane suburbs
- Understands local property values and growth trends
- Has established relationships with North Brisbane real estate agents, conveyancers, and valuers
- Can meet you locally at our Chermside office or your preferred location

### Services We Provide

**First Home Buyers:** Navigate grants, schemes, stamp duty concessions, and low deposit options. We specialize in helping first-timers enter the North Brisbane market with confidence.

**Home Loans & Refinancing:** Compare 50+ lenders to find competitive rates and features. Many North Brisbane homeowners save $200-400 per month by refinancing to better rates.

**Investment Property Loans:** Structure loans to maximize tax deductions and cash flow. North Brisbane offers excellent investment opportunities with strong rental demand and capital growth.

**Construction Loans:** Building your dream home in North Lakes, Mango Hill, or surrounding estates? We arrange construction finance with progress payments.

**Specialty Lending:** SMSF loans, commercial property finance, self-employed loans, guarantor arrangements, and private lending when banks say no.

### Our Process

**1. Free Consultation:** We discuss your goals, assess your financial position, and explain your borrowing capacity. No obligation, completely free.

**2. Loan Comparison:** We research 50+ lenders and present options suited to your needs with full transparency on rates, fees, and features.

**3. Application & Approval:** We handle paperwork, liaise with lenders, and manage your application through to conditional approval—typically within 24-48 hours for North Brisbane properties.

**4. Settlement Support:** We manage the process through to settlement, ensuring all conditions are met and funds are ready for your settlement date.

**5. Ongoing Service:** We review your loan annually to ensure you remain competitive. As your circumstances change, we're here to help with refinancing, upgrades, or additional properties.
