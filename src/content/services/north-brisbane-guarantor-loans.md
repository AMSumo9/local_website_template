## Guarantor Home Loans North Brisbane: Parents Helping Kids Buy

Can't save a full 20% deposit? Family guarantee loans allow parents to use their home equity to support your purchase—helping you buy sooner while avoiding Lenders Mortgage Insurance (LMI). Popular with North Brisbane first home buyers purchasing in North Lakes, Mango Hill, or Chermside.

### How Guarantor Loans Work

**Security Guarantee:**
Parent(s) offer their home (or part of it) as additional security for your loan. This "tops up" your deposit, allowing you to borrow with minimal cash deposit while avoiding LMI. Your parents don't give you money—they provide equity security.

**Limited Guarantee:**
Most lenders offer limited guarantees—parents guarantee only the shortfall amount (typically 10-20% of purchase price), not the entire loan. For a $700k property, parents might guarantee $100k, not the full $700k.

**Separate Loans:**
Your loan and parents' guarantee are legally separate. Parents don't make repayments unless you default. Their property isn't combined with yours—it's held as security only for the guaranteed portion.

### Benefits of Guarantor Loans

**Avoid Lenders Mortgage Insurance:**
LMI can cost $10-30k when borrowing above 80% LVR. Guarantor loans eliminate this cost, saving thousands in upfront fees. These savings can go toward furniture, renovations, or retained as savings buffer.

**Buy Sooner:**
Instead of saving for years to reach 20% deposit, you can buy now with minimal deposit (often 5-10%). In rising markets like North Brisbane (+5.2% annual growth), buying sooner means capturing capital growth earlier.

**Better Borrowing Capacity:**
Some lenders increase borrowing capacity when parents guarantee. Strong parental equity strengthens overall application, potentially allowing you to buy in better suburbs or larger homes.

**Build Equity Faster:**
Once you've built 20% equity (through repayments and capital growth), you can refinance and release your parents from the guarantee. In North Brisbane's growth suburbs like North Lakes or Mango Hill, this often occurs within 3-5 years.

### Parent Responsibilities & Risks

**Liable if You Default:**
If you can't make repayments, parents are legally responsible for the guaranteed amount. Lender can sell parents' property if necessary to recover debts. This is serious—we ensure both parties understand the risks clearly.

**Credit Impact:**
The guarantee appears on parents' credit file as a contingent liability. This may affect parents' own borrowing capacity if they want to refinance or borrow for other purposes.

**Property Restrictions:**
While guaranteeing, parents may face restrictions selling or refinancing their own property. Most lenders require consent before parents can sell the security property.

**How to Protect Parents:**
We structure guarantees to minimize parent risk through limited guarantees (not full loan amount), clear exit strategies (refinance timeline), and choosing lenders with flexible release policies.

### Release Guarantee Process

**Build to 80% LVR:**
Once your loan reduces to 80% LVR (through repayments and property growth), you can refinance to remove parents' guarantee. This releases their property from security obligations.

**North Brisbane Growth Advantage:**
With 5-6% annual growth in suburbs like North Lakes, Mango Hill, and Redcliffe, many borrowers reach 80% LVR within 3-5 years through capital growth alone—even without extra repayments.

**Refinance to Release:**
Submit refinance application showing current property value and remaining loan amount. Once lender confirms 80% LVR, parents' guarantee is released and their property is freed.

### Who Qualifies as Guarantor?

**Parents or Close Family:**
Most lenders accept parents, sometimes grandparents or siblings. Lenders rarely accept friends or non-relatives as guarantors.

**Property Ownership:**
Guarantors must own property in Australia with sufficient equity. Property must be residential (not commercial) and in guarantor's name.

**Age Limits:**
Some lenders impose age limits (typically under 60-65 at application). Older guarantors may face restrictions or shorter guarantee terms.

**Strong Financials:**
Guarantors need clean credit history, stable income (or retirement income), and manageable existing debts. Lender assesses guarantor's financial position thoroughly.

### Alternatives to Guarantor Loans

**First Home Guarantee (FHBG):**
Government guarantees 15% allowing 5% deposit without LMI. Limited places annually, strict eligibility criteria, income caps apply. We help you apply if eligible.

**Genuine Savings:**
Save 5% deposit ($35k for $700k property) over 3-6 months. Demonstrate savings discipline through regular deposits. Qualify for 95% LVR with LMI (cost $15-25k).

**Gift from Parents:**
Parents gift cash for deposit rather than offering property as security. Gift doesn't need to be repaid, creates no ongoing obligations, simpler structure. We prepare required statutory declarations.

### Popular North Brisbane Suburbs for Guarantor Buyers

**Entry-Level ($600-700k):**
Mango Hill, Petrie, Brendale, Strathpine, Kallangur—modern homes suitable for first home buyers with family guarantees.

**Mid-Range ($700-800k):**
North Lakes, Redcliffe, Aspley—premium family suburbs where guarantor loans help younger buyers access better locations.

**Example:**
Purchase $720k North Lakes home with 5% deposit ($36k savings). Parents guarantee $108k (15% of purchase). Total security: your $36k + parents' $108k = 20% deposit equivalent. No LMI required. You build equity through growth and repayments, refinance in 3-5 years to release parents.

### We Explain Everything Clearly

Guarantor loans involve both you and your parents. We meet with all parties (together or separately) to ensure everyone understands commitments, risks, and exit strategies before proceeding.
