## Refinancing Your North Brisbane Home Loan

Already own in North Brisbane? Refinancing can save $200-400/month, access equity for renovations or investment, improve loan features, or consolidate debts. We compare 50+ lenders to find your best refinance deal.

### Why Refinance Your North Brisbane Home?

**Reduce Interest Rates:** Many North Brisbane homeowners haven't reviewed loans in 3-5 years. Rates may have decreased or you may qualify for better rates (improved income, reduced loan-to-value ratio). Savings of 0.5-1.5% translate to $200-400/month on typical North Brisbane loan amounts.

**Access Equity:** North Brisbane growth (4-8% annually) means many owners have built substantial equity. Access this for:
- Renovations (kitchen, bathroom, extensions)
- Investment property deposits
- Debt consolidation
- Business purposes
- Major purchases (vehicles, education)

**Improve Features:** Add offset accounts, switch to better internet banking, remove monthly/annual fees, get unlimited extra repayments, port loans between properties.

**Consolidate Debts:** Roll credit cards and personal loans into home loan at much lower rates (6% vs 15-20% for cards, 8-12% for personal loans).

### How Much Can You Save?

**Example: $700k loan, 6.5% rate:**
- Refinance to 5.9% = save $295/month ($3,540 annually)
- Refinance to 6.0% = save $246/month ($2,952 annually)

**Example: $850k loan, 6.3% rate:**
- Refinance to 5.8% = save $357/month ($4,284 annually)

**Break-Even Analysis:** Refinancing typically costs $500-1,500 (discharge fees, application fees, valuation). We calculate break-even period—usually 3-6 months of savings covers costs.

### Accessing Equity for Renovations

Many North Brisbane homeowners refinance to access equity for renovations:

**Example:** Purchase price $720k, current value $820k (growth), loan remaining $550k.
- **Available Equity:** $656k (80% of $820k) minus $550k = $106k accessible
- **Typical Use:** $60k kitchen/bathroom renovation, $30k extension, $16k landscaping

Renovations often add more value than they cost, particularly in established suburbs (Chermside, Kedron, Aspley, Stafford) where quality renovations are rewarded.

### The Refinancing Process

**Step 1: Loan Review (Free)**
We analyze your current loan—rate, features, remaining term, break costs (if fixed), and costs to refinance. You'll know if refinancing makes financial sense.

**Step 2: Compare Options**
We compare 50+ lenders and present 2-3 best options with clear comparison of rates, fees, features, and total savings over loan life.

**Step 3: Application**
If you proceed, we submit application. Most refinances approve within 5-7 days (faster than purchases since you already own the property).

**Step 4: Valuation**
New lender values your North Brisbane property. Recent North Brisbane growth means valuations often come in higher than purchase price—improving your loan-to-value ratio.

**Step 5: Settlement**
New lender pays out old loan and takes over security. Typically settles 4-6 weeks from application. You start saving immediately.

### When NOT to Refinance

**High Break Costs:** If you're in fixed loan with significant break costs (can be $5-20k), refinancing may not be worthwhile. We calculate break costs and compare to savings.

**Short Remaining Term:** If you only have 2-3 years left on loan, refinance costs may exceed savings. Better to ride out existing loan.

**Poor Credit:** If credit score has decreased since original loan (job loss, missed payments, increased debts), you may not access better rates. We'll assess before proceeding.

### Refinancing Investment Properties

Investment property refinancing works similarly but with additional considerations:

- Structure for tax efficiency (interest-only, offset accounts)
- Access equity for next investment property deposit
- Consolidate multiple investment loans for better rates
- Switch from construction loan to standard loan (post-completion)
