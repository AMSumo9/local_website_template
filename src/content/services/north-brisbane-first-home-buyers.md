## First Home Buyers North Brisbane: Your Journey Starts Here

Buying your first home in North Brisbane? We specialize in helping first-timers navigate the process—from understanding borrowing capacity to securing pre-approval and settlement. With access to 50+ lenders and knowledge of all government schemes, we make your first purchase simple.

### Understanding Your Borrowing Capacity

**How Much Can You Borrow?**
As a rough guide, lenders typically offer 5-6x your gross household income. For example:
- **$80k income:** Borrow $400-480k (suitable for Deception Bay, Kallangur)
- **$100k income:** Borrow $500-600k (Caboolture, Brendale, Mango Hill)
- **$120k income:** Borrow $600-720k (Petrie, Redcliffe, Strathpine, Aspley)
- **$150k income:** Borrow $750-900k (Chermside, North Lakes, Kedron)

We provide precise calculations based on your income, expenses, existing debts, and deposit.

### Government Assistance for First Home Buyers

**First Home Owner Grant (FHOG):**
$15,000 grant for new homes or substantially renovated homes under $750,000. Must be first home purchase, must move in within 12 months, and live there for at least 12 months.

**First Home Guarantee (FHBG):**
Purchase with 5% deposit without paying Lenders Mortgage Insurance. Government guarantees the additional 15%, allowing you to avoid LMI (saves $10-30k). Limited places available annually—we help you apply quickly.

**Stamp Duty Concessions:**
Queensland offers stamp duty concessions for first home buyers on properties under $550,000. We calculate your eligibility and savings.

### Deposit Requirements Explained

**Standard Options:**
- **20% Deposit:** No LMI, best rates, full lender choice
- **10-15% Deposit:** LMI applies ($5-15k cost), most lenders available
- **5-10% Deposit:** Higher LMI ($15-30k cost), some lender restrictions
- **5% Deposit (FHBG):** No LMI with government guarantee, limited availability

**Family Guarantor:**
Parents use their home equity as additional security, allowing you to purchase with minimal deposit and avoid LMI. We arrange guarantor loans and explain parent responsibilities clearly.

**Step 3: Property Search**
Shop with confidence knowing your pre-approved amount. We advise on property types lenders prefer and help you make competitive offers.

**Step 4: Formal Application**
Once you've found your property, we submit formal application with contract, building & pest reports, and any other required documents.

We coordinate with conveyancer, lender, and real estate agent to ensure smooth settlement. You receive keys to your first North Brisbane home!

Generally no for FHOG and FHBG—both applicants must be first home buyers. However, standard loans available with suitable deposits.
