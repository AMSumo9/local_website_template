## Self Employed Home Loans North Brisbane

Self-employed, contractor, or small business owner? Traditional income verification doesn't work for you. We specialize in home loans for self-employed North Brisbane residents—using accountant declarations, BAS statements, and alternative income verification to secure your home loan.

### Challenges for Self-Employed Borrowers

**Income Verification:**
PAYG employees show payslips. Self-employed income fluctuates, includes deductions, and appears lower on tax returns than actual cash flow. Lenders struggle to assess true earning capacity using standard criteria.

**Tax Minimization:**
Smart business owners minimize tax through deductions, depreciation, and business structures. This reduces taxable income on tax returns—the same documents lenders use to assess borrowing capacity. Result: qualified borrowers appear to earn less than they do.

**Trading History:**
Lenders typically require 2 years ABN history. Start-ups and recently self-employed borrowers face difficulties meeting these requirements with mainstream lenders.

### Self-Employed Loan Options

**Full Doc Loans:**
Provide 2 years tax returns, 2 years financial statements (P&L, balance sheet), ATO portal access. Lenders verify income through tax returns and financials. Best rates available but requires clean financials showing strong income.

**Low Doc Loans:**
Reduced documentation requirements—often just accountant's declaration confirming income, recent BAS statements, and business bank statements. Suitable when tax returns don't reflect true income. Rates typically 0.3-0.8% higher than full doc. Minimum 20% deposit usually required.

**Alternative Documentation (Alt Doc):**
Business bank statements (6-12 months) demonstrate cash flow without tax returns. Lender calculates income based on deposits and business activity. Suitable for early-stage businesses or those without recent tax returns. Rates 0.5-1.2% above standard rates.

**Accountant Declarations:**
Many lenders accept accountant letters declaring your income rather than full tax returns. Accountant must be qualified (CPA, CA) and confirms income based on business performance. Quick approval pathway for established businesses with solid cash flow.

### Income Assessment Methods

**ABN Income:**
If you're sole trader, lenders assess income as: Gross income minus business expenses plus add-backs (depreciation, non-cash deductions). Some lenders add back 50-100% of depreciation to better reflect cash flow.

**Company/Trust Income:**
If income flows through company or trust, lenders assess profit distributions. Some lenders accept director salaries plus distributions. Complex structures require specialist lenders who understand business entities.

**Contract Income:**
Long-term contractors with stable contract history can sometimes qualify for standard loans. Lenders assess average contract income over 12-24 months, preferring single long-term contracts over multiple short contracts.

### Documentation Typically Required

**Minimum 2 Years Trading:**
Most lenders require minimum 2 years ABN registration. Some specialist lenders accept 12 months for established industries (medical, legal, accounting, trades). Start-ups under 12 months face significant challenges.

**Business Bank Statements:**
Demonstrate consistent deposits and healthy cash flow. Lenders look for stable or growing income, not erratic or declining trends.

**Accountant Verification:**
Letter from accountant (CPA or CA) confirming business viability, income levels, and sometimes future income projections. Strong accountant relationships help smooth approvals.

**Credit File:**
Self-employed borrowers need clean credit. Late payments, defaults, or court judgments weigh more heavily than for PAYG borrowers. Maintain spotless credit history—pay all bills on time.

### Common Self-Employed Occupations We Help

**Tradies:**
Electricians, plumbers, carpenters, builders operating in North Brisbane. Often trade under ABN or small company. Low doc and accountant declarations work well for established tradies.

**Medical Professionals:**
GPs, specialists, dentists, physios—high income but complex structures (private practice, partnerships, trusts). We work with lenders who understand medical professionals' income patterns.

**Consultants & Professionals:**
IT contractors, engineers, accountants, lawyers operating as sole traders or small practices. Demonstrate stable contract income or recurring client base.

**Small Business Owners:**
Retail, hospitality, services businesses in Chermside, North Lakes, Redcliffe. Require consistent business performance demonstrated through BAS and bank statements.

**Creatives & Freelancers:**
Designers, writers, photographers, marketing consultants. Income can be irregular—we structure applications to demonstrate sustainable earning capacity.

### Improving Your Application

**Clean Up Financials:**
Work with accountant to present financials clearly. Ensure BAS lodgments are up to date, tax returns lodged, and business bank statements show healthy cash flow.

**Larger Deposit:**
20%+ deposit significantly improves approval odds and rate offerings. Self-employed borrowers with 30-40% deposits access near-standard rates.

**Reduce Personal Debts:**
Pay down credit cards, personal loans, car loans before applying. Lower personal commitments improve serviceability calculations.

**Maintain Separate Accounts:**
Keep business and personal finances separate. Mixing funds creates confusion for lenders and raises red flags about business viability.

### We Understand Self-Employed Income

Unlike bank branch staff, we specialize in self-employed lending. We know which lenders accept which documentation, how to present your income favorably, and which loan structures suit your business type.
