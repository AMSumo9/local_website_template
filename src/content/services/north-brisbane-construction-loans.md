## Construction Loans North Brisbane: Build Your Dream Home

Building your dream home in North Brisbane? Construction loans differ from standard mortgages—funds release progressively as building stages complete. We arrange construction finance for house and land packages, knockdown rebuilds, and custom builds across North Lakes, Mango Hill, and established suburbs.

### How Construction Loans Work

**Progress Payment Structure:**
Construction loans release funds in stages as building progresses. Typical stages include:
- **Deposit/Slab Stage:** 5-10% on foundation completion
- **Frame Stage:** 15-20% when frame is erected
- **Lock-Up Stage:** 35-40% when roof, windows, doors installed
- **Fixing Stage:** 25-30% when internal fitout complete
- **Completion:** Final 10-15% when building approved and certified

Lender inspectors verify each stage before releasing funds. This protects both you and the lender—ensuring work is completed to standard before payment.

### Interest During Construction

**Interest-Only on Drawn Amounts:**
During construction (typically 6-12 months), you pay interest only on funds already drawn. For example, if your loan is $700k but only $200k has been released (deposit + slab), you pay interest on $200k, not the full $700k. This minimizes costs while building.

**Rent + Interest Management:**
If you're renting while building, you'll pay both rent and construction loan interest. We help you budget for this overlap period and structure loans to minimize costs.

### House & Land Packages vs Custom Builds

**House & Land Packages:**
Developer provides land with builder contracts already established. Benefits include:
- Fixed price certainty (less variation risk)
- Faster approval (lenders familiar with established builders)
- Turnkey solution (less decision fatigue)
- Often eligible for FHOG ($15k for new builds under $750k)

Popular North Brisbane estates offering house and land packages: North Lakes, Mango Hill, Caboolture, Petrie.

**Custom Builds:**
You own land and engage builder separately. Benefits include:
- Full design control (architect-designed homes)
- Land selection flexibility (choose your own block)
- Unique home (not cookie-cutter designs)

Requires more involvement and carries higher approval scrutiny from lenders (detailed plans, builder credentials, quantity surveyor reports).

### Knockdown Rebuilds

Own an older North Brisbane home on valuable land? Knockdown rebuilds involve demolishing existing dwelling and building new. Considerations include:

**Finance Structure:** Some lenders offer single-loan solutions (demolition + construction). Others require separate demolition finance then construction loan. We arrange the most efficient structure.

**Valuation Approach:** Lender values based on "as if complete" value, not current value. Requires detailed plans and quantity surveyor report.

**Popular Suburbs:** Kedron, Nundah, Aspley, Stafford—older homes on large blocks where land value exceeds dwelling value.

### Owner Builder Loans

Building yourself (owner builder) requires specialist lenders. Most mainstream lenders don't support owner building due to higher risk. Requirements include:
- Owner builder license (mandatory in Queensland)
- Detailed building plans and specifications
- Project management experience demonstrated
- Higher deposits (typically 20-30%)

We connect you with lenders who support owner builders, though rates are typically 0.5-1% higher than standard construction loans.

### Choosing the Right Builder

**Lender-Preferred Builders:**
Lenders maintain lists of approved builders. Major builders (Metricon, Henley, G.J. Gardner, Coral Homes, Masterton) have established relationships with lenders—applications approve faster with less scrutiny.

**Fixed Price Contracts:**
Lenders strongly prefer fixed-price contracts. Cost-plus or variable contracts carry higher risk and may be declined or require larger deposits.

**Builder Financial Health:**
We verify builder solvency before recommending. Builder collapse mid-construction is devastating—we help you avoid risky situations.

### From Construction to Standard Loan

Once building completes and you move in, construction loans convert to standard principal & interest mortgages. Conversion typically occurs within 30 days of completion. We ensure smooth transition with competitive rates locked in before conversion.
