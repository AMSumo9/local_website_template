## Commercial Property Loans North Brisbane

Purchasing commercial property in North Brisbane? Whether you're buying your business premises, investing in commercial real estate, or expanding your property portfolio, we arrange competitive commercial finance across retail, office, warehouse, and industrial properties.

### Types of Commercial Properties We Finance

**Retail Premises:**
Shops, restaurants, cafes in Chermside (Westfield precinct), North Lakes shopping districts, Strathpine, Redcliffe. Lenders assess lease terms, tenant quality, and location strength. Strong locations with national tenants attract better rates.

**Office Space:**
Professional suites in Chermside, North Lakes business parks, Brendale commercial precincts. Single-tenancy (owner-occupied) and multi-tenancy (investment) both supported. Lenders prefer properties with parking, lift access, and modern amenities.

**Warehouses & Industrial:**
Brendale, Strathpine, and Caboolture industrial estates. Distribution centers, manufacturing facilities, storage units. Lenders assess zoning, clearance heights, truck access, and proximity to transport routes (Bruce Highway, Gateway Motorway).

**Mixed-Use Properties:**
Ground floor retail with residential or office above. Common in Chermside, Nundah, Kedron main streets. Lenders assess both residential and commercial components separately.

### Commercial Loan Structures

**Interest Rates:**
Commercial rates typically sit 1-2% above residential rates. Current indicative rates: 7.0-8.5% depending on property type, loan size, deposit, and borrower strength. Larger loans ($1M+) often access better pricing.

**Loan-to-Value Ratios:**
Commercial lenders typically lend 60-70% LVR (requiring 30-40% deposit). Lower LVRs reflect higher risk compared to residential. Exceptional properties with strong tenants may access 75% LVR.

**Loan Terms:**
Commercial loans typically run 3-25 years. Many lenders offer interest-only periods (1-5 years) before reverting to principal & interest. Longer terms suit owner-occupied businesses building equity; shorter terms suit investors maximizing cash flow.

**Interest-Only vs Principal & Interest:**
Most commercial borrowers choose interest-only to maximize tax deductions and preserve cash flow. Business owners often prefer to invest capital in growing the business rather than paying down property debt.

### Owner-Occupied vs Investment

**Owner-Occupied Commercial:**
You operate your business from the property. Benefits include:
- Build equity while paying "rent to yourself"
- No landlord restrictions (modify premises as needed)
- Potential capital growth
- Interest 100% tax-deductible as business expense
- GST claimable on purchase (if registered)

**Commercial Investment:**
You purchase property to lease to tenants. Benefits include:
- Passive income stream
- Capital growth potential
- Depreciation benefits (building, fitout, plant & equipment)
- Leverage your capital across multiple properties

Lenders assess investment commercials more stringently—tenant quality, lease terms, and rental coverage are critical.

### Serviceability Requirements

**Business Financials:**
Lenders assess business viability through tax returns, BAS statements, profit & loss, balance sheets. Minimum 2 years trading history typically required. Start-ups face stricter requirements (higher deposits, personal guarantees).

**Rental Coverage:**
For investment commercials, rental income must cover loan repayments by 120-140%. If rent is $5,000/month, loan repayments should not exceed $3,500-4,000/month.

**Personal Guarantees:**
Most commercial loans require personal guarantees from directors/owners. This means personal assets (including your home) may be at risk if business defaults. We explain these risks clearly before proceeding.

### Valuation Considerations

**Commercial Valuations:**
Commercial valuers assess income-producing capacity, not just land and building value. Strong leases to quality tenants significantly enhance valuations. Vacant commercial properties value lower due to income uncertainty.

**Specialized Valuers:**
Commercial properties require specialist commercial valuers. Valuation costs typically $1,500-5,000 depending on property complexity. We arrange lender-approved valuers to avoid delays.

### Popular North Brisbane Commercial Areas

**Brendale:** Major industrial hub—warehouses, manufacturing, distribution. Bruce Highway access drives demand.
