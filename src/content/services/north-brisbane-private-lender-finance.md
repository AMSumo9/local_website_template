## Private Lender Finance North Brisbane: Alternative Lending Solutions

When traditional banks decline your application, private lenders offer alternative financing. Higher rates and fees, but provides solutions for bad credit, complex income situations, urgent settlements, or unique property types that mainstream lenders won't touch.

### What Are Private Lenders?

**Non-Bank Lenders:**
Private lenders are individuals, syndicates, or specialist finance companies that lend their own capital (not depositor funds like banks). They assess risk differently, focus on property security value over borrower income/credit, and can approve deals banks reject.

**Asset-Based Lending:**
Private lenders prioritize property value and equity position. If property is worth $800k and you need to borrow $500k (62% LVR), they care more about the $300k equity buffer than your credit score or employment history.

### When to Consider Private Finance

**Credit Issues:**
Defaults, judgments, bankruptcies on credit file. Banks auto-decline these situations. Private lenders assess on case-by-case basis, focusing on current financial position and property security.

**Urgent Settlement:**
Auction purchase requiring settlement in 14-30 days. Banks can't approve fast enough. Private lenders can approve and settle within 7-14 days if valuation and legals are straightforward.

**Complex Income:**
Newly self-employed (under 12 months), cash-based income, foreign income, commission-heavy roles. Banks struggle to verify income; private lenders accept alternative verification methods.

**Unique Properties:**
Serviced apartments, properties above commercial premises, large acreage, unusual construction types. Banks impose strict property criteria; private lenders assess on security value alone.

**Bridging Finance:**
Purchasing new property before selling existing property. Need short-term loan (3-12 months) until sale completes. Private lenders specialize in bridging loans.

**Divorce Settlements:**
Property settlements requiring one party to buy out the other urgently. Private loans provide fast interim finance while permanent finance is arranged.

### Private Loan Costs

**Interest Rates:**
Typically 8-15% p.a. depending on risk profile, loan size, LVR, and loan term. Higher risk (poor credit, low equity) commands higher rates. Most private loans are interest-only.

**Establishment Fees:**
Usually 2-5% of loan amount upfront. For $500k loan, expect $10-25k establishment fee. This compensates lender for higher risk and faster processing.

**Monthly/Ongoing Fees:**
Some lenders charge monthly service fees ($50-200/month) or line fees (0.5-1% annually) in addition to interest.

**Total Cost Example:**
$600k loan at 10% p.a. with 3% establishment fee = $18k upfront + $60k annual interest ($5k/month). High cost, but enables transactions banks won't fund.

### Typical Private Loan Structures

**Short-Term (3-12 Months):**
Most private loans are short-term solutions. You exit by refinancing to bank, selling property, or completing other transaction (property sale, business sale, inheritance). Not intended as long-term finance.

**Interest-Only:**
Almost all private loans are interest-only with balloon payment at term end. You pay monthly interest and repay full principal when term ends or refinancing completes.

**First or Second Mortgages:**
First mortgages (no existing loan on property) attract better rates. Second mortgages (behind existing bank loan) carry higher rates due to subordinate security position.

**Maximum LVR:**
Private lenders typically lend up to 65-75% LVR (requiring 25-35% equity). Higher LVRs possible but with significantly higher rates. Some lenders won't exceed 70% LVR regardless of circumstances.

### Private Lender Assessment Criteria

**Equity Position:**
How much equity exists in property? Lenders want meaningful equity buffer (minimum 25-30%) to protect their capital if forced to sell.

**Property Location:**
Is property in metropolitan area with strong demand? North Brisbane suburbs (North Lakes, Chermside, Aspley) are viewed favorably—liquid market, strong values, easy to sell if required.

**Exit Strategy:**
How will you repay loan at term end? Viable exit strategies include bank refinance (once credit improves or income verified), property sale, business transaction completion, or inheritance/funds from other source.

**Legal Clarity:**
Clear title, no legal disputes, straightforward ownership. Private lenders avoid legal complexity that could delay recovery if default occurs.

### Transitioning to Bank Finance

**The 12-Month Plan:**
Most borrowers use private finance as 12-month bridge while fixing issues preventing bank approval. During this period:

- **Rebuild Credit:** Make all payments on time, clear defaults, settle judgments
- **Establish Income:** Complete 2nd year of tax returns (self-employed), stabilize employment
- **Build Equity:** Property growth and loan repayments improve LVR
- **Prepare Refinance:** We arrange bank refinance 3-6 months before private loan expires

**Refinance Savings:**
Moving from 12% private loan to 6.5% bank loan on $600k saves $33k annually ($2,750/month). Worthwhile to pay higher private rates temporarily to access lower bank rates long-term.

### Risks of Private Lending

**High Costs:**
Interest and fees can be 3-5x higher than bank loans. Ensure transaction justifies these costs—avoid private finance for minor convenience.

**Short Terms:**
If you can't refinance or sell within loan term, lender may force sale or extend at even higher rates. Have realistic exit strategy before proceeding.

**Contractual Obligations:**
Read loan agreements carefully. Some private lenders impose harsh penalty clauses, early exit fees, or restrictive terms. We review all loan documents before you sign.

### North Brisbane Properties & Private Finance

Private lenders favor North Brisbane properties due to:
- Strong underlying value and demand
- Established suburbs with liquidity (Chermside, Aspley, Kedron)
- Growth areas with capital appreciation (North Lakes, Mango Hill)
- Easy to value and sell if required

This favorable view can translate to better rates and higher LVRs for quality North Brisbane properties.
