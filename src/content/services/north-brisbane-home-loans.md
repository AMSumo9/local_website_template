**Maximize Borrowing:** With median prices ranging from $555k (Deception Bay) to $950k (Kedron), borrowing capacity matters. We position applications to maximize what lenders will offer.

**Choose Features:** Offset accounts, redraw facilities, split loans (part fixed/part variable), extra repayments—we explain features relevant to your situation.

**Navigate LMI:** If your deposit is under 20%, Lenders Mortgage Insurance applies. We'll show total costs and explore ways to minimize or avoid LMI where possible.

### Investment Property Loans

Building wealth through North Brisbane property? Investment loans require different structuring:

**Interest-Only Options:** Maximize tax deductions by keeping interest costs high. We compare interest-only rates (typically 0.2-0.3% above principal & interest).

**Cash Flow Optimization:** Structure loans to minimize out-of-pocket costs. Offset accounts against investment loans can provide flexibility while maintaining tax deductions.

### Fast Pre-Approval for Competitive Market

North Brisbane properties—particularly well-presented homes in North Lakes, Chermside, and Aspley—often sell within 2-3 weeks. Pre-approval is essential:

**24-Hour Turnaround:** Most clients receive conditional approval within one business day.

**Shopping Confidence:** Pre-approval confirms borrowing capacity and shows sellers you're a serious, qualified buyer.

**Rate Lock Options:** Some lenders allow rate locks at pre-approval stage, protecting you from rate rises during property search.

### Refinancing Your North Brisbane Home Loan

Already own in North Brisbane? Refinancing can:

**Progress Payments:** Funds released at slab, frame, lock-up, fixing, and completion stages as builder invoices.

**Interest-Only During Construction:** Pay interest only on drawn funds during build (typically 6-12 months).
