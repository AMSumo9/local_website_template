## Government Grants and Schemes for Queensland First Home Buyers

Government assistance programs help first home buyers enter the property market sooner. Understanding available grants, guarantees, and concessions can save tens of thousands of dollars. Here's everything Queensland first home buyers need to know.

### First Home Owner Grant (FHOG)

**Grant Amount: $15,000**

The FHOG provides $15,000 toward purchasing or building your first home in Queensland. This is a genuine grant—you don't repay it.

**Eligibility Requirements:**
- Must be first home buyer (you and partner have never owned property)
- Must be Australian citizen or permanent resident
- Must be 18+ years old
- Property must be new home, substantially renovated home, or newly constructed home
- Property value must be under $750,000
- Must move in within 12 months of settlement
- Must live in property as principal residence for minimum 12 months

**What Qualifies as "New":**
- House and land package (newly built)
- Off-the-plan apartment/townhouse (newly constructed)
- Substantially renovated home (significant structural changes, not just cosmetic)
- Custom-built home on land you own

**What Doesn't Qualify:**
- Established homes (previously occupied)
- Vacant land only (without building contract)
- Investment properties
- Properties over $750,000

**Application Process:**
Apply through Office of State Revenue Queensland when settling your property. We coordinate with your conveyancer to ensure application is submitted correctly and grant is paid at settlement.

### First Home Guarantee (FHBG)

**Purchase with 5% Deposit, No LMI**

The FHBG is a federal government scheme allowing first home buyers to purchase with just 5% deposit without paying Lenders Mortgage Insurance. The government guarantees the additional 15%.

**Eligibility Requirements:**
- Must be first home buyer (never owned property in Australia)
- Must be Australian citizen or permanent resident
- Property value caps: $700,000 (Brisbane/Gold Coast), $600,000 (regional Queensland)
- Income caps: $125,000 (single), $200,000 (couple)
- Must live in property as principal residence

**How It Works:**
Normally borrowing above 80% LVR requires LMI ($10-30k cost). The government guarantee replaces LMI, saving you thousands. You still need 5% deposit ($35,000 for $700,000 property).

**Limited Places:**
35,000 places nationally per financial year, allocated to participating lenders. Places fill quickly—apply early in the financial year (July-September) for best chance.

**Participating Lenders:**
Major banks and many second-tier lenders participate. We know which lenders have FHBG allocation remaining and process applications efficiently.

**North Brisbane Examples:**
- $640k Mango Hill townhouse: 5% deposit = $32,000 (vs $128k for 20% deposit)
- $700k North Lakes house: 5% deposit = $35,000 (vs $140k for 20% deposit)

### Regional First Home Buyer Guarantee (RFHBG)

**Similar to FHBG for Regional Areas**

Same structure as FHBG but applies to regional Queensland areas. Higher property cap ($600,000) and dedicated allocation.

**Which North Brisbane Suburbs Qualify:**
Most North Brisbane suburbs are classified as Brisbane metro, not regional. Caboolture and areas north may qualify—we verify eligibility case-by-case.

### Stamp Duty Concessions

**Significant Savings on Transfer Duty**

Queensland offers stamp duty concessions for first home buyers purchasing properties under $550,000.

**Concession Structure:**
- **Under $500,000:** Nil stamp duty (full exemption)
- **$500,000-$550,000:** Concessional rate (partial exemption)
- **Over $550,000:** No concession (standard rates apply)

**Savings Examples:**
- **$480,000 property:** Save $13,550 (full exemption from standard $13,550 stamp duty)
- **$525,000 property:** Save approximately $8,000 (partial concession)
- **$600,000 property:** No concession (pay full stamp duty of $17,325)

**Eligibility:**
- Must be first home buyer
- Must be Australian citizen or permanent resident
- Property value under $550,000
- Must occupy as principal residence for 12 months

**North Brisbane Opportunities:**
Suburbs under $550k median include Deception Bay ($555k—just over, but individual properties available under $550k), Kallangur ($585k), and parts of Caboolture.

### Family Home Guarantee

**For Single Parents with Dependents**

Single parents with at least one dependent child can purchase with 2% deposit without LMI.

**Eligibility:**
- Single parent with dependent child under 18
- Income cap: $125,000
- Property cap: $700,000 (Brisbane)
- Must be Australian citizen or permanent resident
- Can be previous homeowner (not limited to first home buyers)

**Substantial Benefit:**
2% deposit on $700,000 property = $14,000 (vs $140,000 for 20% deposit). Significant help for single parents building housing security.

### Home Guarantee Scheme Comparison

| Scheme | Deposit | Income Cap | Property Cap | Who Qualifies |
|--------|---------|------------|--------------|---------------|
| FHBG | 5% | $125k / $200k | $700k | First home buyers |
| RFHBG | 5% | $125k / $200k | $600k | First buyers (regional) |
| Family | 2% | $125,000 | $700k | Single parents |

### Combining FHOG and FHBG

**Can You Use Both?**

Yes! If buying new home under $750,000, you can receive:
- FHOG: $15,000 grant
- FHBG: Access to 5% deposit (no LMI)
- Stamp duty concession: If under $550,000

**Example:**
Purchase $680,000 house and land package in Caboolture:
- 5% deposit = $34,000
- FHOG = $15,000 toward purchase
- Effective deposit = $34,000 - $15,000 grant = $19,000 from your savings
- Save LMI cost of approximately $22,000

**Total benefit: $37,000 ($15k grant + $22k LMI saved)**

### How to Apply

**FHOG:**
Apply through Office of State Revenue Queensland during settlement. Your conveyancer typically coordinates this.

**FHBG/Family Home Guarantee:**
Apply through participating lender when obtaining home loan. We handle applications and know which lenders have allocation.

**Stamp Duty Concession:**
Claimed when stamp duty is assessed during property transfer. Your conveyancer ensures concession is applied correctly.

### Common Questions

**Q: Can I use FHOG for established home?**
No, FHOG only applies to new or substantially renovated homes.

**Q: What if my partner owned property but I haven't?**
You don't qualify—both applicants must be first home buyers.

**Q: Can I rent out a room while living in the property?**
Yes, as long as you occupy as principal residence. Renting a room doesn't violate residency requirements.

**Q: What happens if I sell within 12 months?**
You may need to repay grants and lose concessions. Hardship exemptions exist for job relocation, relationship breakdown, financial hardship.

### Maximizing Your Benefits

Government assistance can reduce upfront costs by $20,000-40,000—significant help entering the market. We ensure you access every eligible benefit and structure your purchase optimally.
