## Complete First Home Buyer Guide for North Brisbane

Buying your first North Brisbane home feels overwhelming—saving deposits, understanding borrowing capacity, navigating contracts, and competing with experienced buyers. This guide simplifies the process into manageable steps.

### Step 1: Understand Your Borrowing Capacity

**How Much Can You Borrow?**
Lenders typically offer 5-6 times your gross household income. Quick estimates:
- **$80k income:** Borrow $400-480k (Deception Bay, Kallangur)
- **$100k income:** Borrow $500-600k (Caboolture, Mango Hill, Brendale)
- **$120k income:** Borrow $600-720k (Petrie, Strathpine, Aspley, North Lakes)

**Factors Affecting Capacity:**
Lenders assess income, existing debts (credit cards, personal loans, HECS), living expenses, and credit history. Clean credit and minimal debts maximize borrowing capacity.

**Get Precise Calculation:**
Online calculators provide estimates. For accurate borrowing capacity, speak with a mortgage broker who accesses lender criteria directly.

### Step 2: Save Your Deposit

**Minimum Deposit:**
- **5% deposit:** Requires Lenders Mortgage Insurance (LMI) or First Home Guarantee
- **10-15% deposit:** Requires LMI but most lenders available
- **20% deposit:** Avoids LMI, best rates, full lender choice

**Deposit Examples:**
- **$600k property:** $30k (5%), $60k (10%), $120k (20%)
- **$700k property:** $35k (5%), $70k (10%), $140k (20%)

**Genuine Savings:**
Lenders require "genuine savings"—funds saved over 3-6 months through regular deposits. This demonstrates financial discipline. Gift deposits from parents also accepted with statutory declaration.

**Don't Forget Costs:**
Budget for stamp duty ($10-25k), building/pest inspections ($600-1,000), conveyancing ($1,500-2,500), moving costs, and initial furniture/repairs.

### Step 3: Research North Brisbane Suburbs

**Under $600k:**
- **Deception Bay ($555k):** Waterfront, highest growth (8.2%)
- **Kallangur ($585k):** Train access, affordable, family-friendly
- **Caboolture ($610k):** Modern estates, strong growth

**$600-700k:**
- **Mango Hill ($640k):** Rail link, young professionals
- **Brendale ($640k):** Local employment, newer housing
- **Petrie ($660k):** Station precinct, developing amenity
- **Strathpine ($685k):** Central, Westfield access

**$700-800k:**
- **North Lakes ($720k):** Master-planned, premium amenity
- **Redcliffe ($725k):** Beachside lifestyle
- **Aspley ($790k):** Schools, established suburb

**Choosing Your Suburb:**
Consider commute times, school catchments, lifestyle preferences (beach, shopping, parks), and future growth prospects. Visit suburbs multiple times at different times of day.

### Step 4: Understand Government Assistance

**First Home Owner Grant (FHOG):**
$15,000 grant for new homes or substantially renovated homes under $750,000. Must move in within 12 months and live there minimum 12 months.

**First Home Guarantee (FHBG):**
Purchase with 5% deposit without paying LMI. Government guarantees the additional 15%. Limited places annually—apply early. We help you access this scheme.

**Stamp Duty Concessions:**
Queensland offers stamp duty concessions for first home buyers on properties under $550,000. Can save $5,000-15,000 depending on purchase price.

**Income Caps:**
Some schemes have income limits. FHBG caps at $125,000 (single) or $200,000 (couple). FHOG has no income cap but property price cap applies.

### Step 5: Get Pre-Approved

**Why Pre-Approval Matters:**
North Brisbane properties sell quickly—often within first weekend in competitive suburbs like North Lakes and Mango Hill. Pre-approval shows sellers you're serious and can settle.

**What Lenders Assess:**
Income verification (payslips, tax returns), credit check, existing debts, employment stability, and savings history. We handle all documentation and liaise with lenders.

**Conditional vs Unconditional:**
Pre-approval is "conditional"—subject to valuation and no material changes to your financial situation. Once property is valued and contracts exchanged, approval becomes unconditional.

**Timeline:**
We typically provide conditional pre-approval within 24-48 hours. This gives you 90 days to find your property.

### Step 6: Property Search & Inspections

**Set Clear Criteria:**
Define must-haves (bedrooms, bathrooms, car spaces, location) and nice-to-haves. Prioritize essentials—you can renovate, but you can't change location.

**Attend Open Homes:**
Visit properties multiple times. Bring someone experienced to spot issues. Check orientation (north-facing living), street noise, neighboring properties, and general condition.

**Building & Pest Inspections:**
Mandatory for peace of mind. Cost $600-1,000 but can identify $10,000+ repair needs. If major issues are found, renegotiate price or walk away.

### Step 7: Make Offer & Negotiate

**Research Comparable Sales:**
Check recent sales in the suburb for similar properties. This informs your offer price. We can provide recent sales data for North Brisbane suburbs.

**Submit Written Offer:**
Real estate agent presents your offer to seller. Include conditions (finance approval, building/pest inspection satisfactory) to protect yourself.

**Negotiation:**
First offer is rarely accepted. Expect counteroffers. Stay within your budget—don't get emotionally attached and overextend financially.

### Step 8: Exchange Contracts & Settlement

**Cooling-Off Period:**
Queensland offers 5 business days cooling-off (0.25% penalty if you withdraw). Waiving cooling-off makes your offer more attractive but removes protection.

**Finance Clause:**
Ensures you can exit contract if bank doesn't approve loan. Typically 14-21 days. We coordinate with lender to meet deadlines.

**Settlement Day:**
Typically 30-60 days from contract. Your lender pays purchase price to seller, and you receive keys. Conveyancer coordinates all legal transfers.

### Common First Home Buyer Mistakes

**Borrowing Maximum:**
Just because you can borrow $720k doesn't mean you should. Leave buffer for rate rises, expenses, lifestyle. Aim to borrow 80-90% of maximum capacity.

**Skipping Inspections:**
$800 for building/pest inspection can save $50,000+ in undiscovered repairs. Never skip inspections, even on newer homes.

**Ignoring Ongoing Costs:**
Council rates, water, insurance, strata fees (townhouses/units), maintenance add $5-8k annually. Budget for ongoing costs beyond mortgage repayments.

**Emotional Buying:**
Don't fall in love with a property before inspections and finance are approved. Remain objective—it's a financial decision as much as emotional one.

### Getting Started

First home purchase is a significant milestone. With proper planning, clear understanding of your capacity, and expert guidance, you'll navigate the process confidently.
