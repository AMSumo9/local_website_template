## North Brisbane Property Market Update 2024

North Brisbane's property market continues its strong performance through 2024, with steady growth across most suburbs and sustained buyer demand despite national economic headwinds. Here's what's happening in our local market.

### Overall Market Performance

**Annual Growth: +5.2%**
North Brisbane has delivered solid capital growth over the 12 months to October 2024, outpacing Brisbane's overall growth rate of 4.7%. This performance reflects strong fundamentals including infrastructure investment, employment growth, and lifestyle appeal.

**Median House Price: $680,000**
The North Brisbane median sits comfortably below Brisbane's overall median of $795,000, offering relative affordability while maintaining strong growth prospects. This attracts both first home buyers and investors seeking entry into Brisbane's property market.

**Days on Market: 28 Days**
Properties are selling relatively quickly, indicating healthy buyer demand. Well-presented homes in popular suburbs like North Lakes and Chermside often receive multiple offers within the first weekend, particularly in the $600-750k price range.

### Suburb-Level Performance

**Star Performers (7-8% Growth):**
- **Deception Bay:** +8.2% to $555k median—waterfront appeal and affordability driving demand
- **Caboolture:** +8.1% to $610k—modern estates and train access attracting young families
- **Mango Hill:** +7.8% to $640k—Moreton Bay Rail Link supporting strong growth

**Solid Growth (5-6%):**
- **North Lakes:** +6.1% to $720k—premium master-planned community maintaining momentum
- **Petrie:** +6.8% to $660k—station precinct development driving capital appreciation
- **Aspley:** +5.9% to $790k—established suburb with quality schools

**Stable Blue-Chip (3-4%):**
- **Chermside:** +4.2% to $875k—mature market with steady demand
- **Kedron:** +3.8% to $830k—low turnover, tightly held by long-term owners

### What's Driving the Market

**Infrastructure Investment:**
The Moreton Bay Rail Link continues to support growth in North Lakes, Mango Hill, Kallangur, and Petrie. Train stations anchor these suburbs as transport-oriented developments, attracting buyers prioritizing Brisbane CBD access.

**Relative Affordability:**
With Brisbane's median approaching $800k, North Brisbane suburbs offering family homes under $700k represent value. Suburbs like Brendale ($640k), Strathpine ($685k), and Redcliffe ($725k) attract buyers priced out of inner suburbs.

**Employment Hubs:**
Local employment in Chermside (retail, services), Brendale (industrial, manufacturing), and North Lakes (retail, healthcare) reduces commute times and supports rental demand. Residents can live and work locally—a major lifestyle advantage.

**Land Supply Constraints:**
Established suburbs like Chermside, Aspley, and Kedron have limited development sites. Scarcity supports price growth as demand exceeds supply. New estates in Caboolture and Mango Hill absorb buyers seeking modern homes.

### Buyer Composition

**First Home Buyers: 35-40%**
Strong presence in entry-level suburbs (Deception Bay, Kallangur, Mango Hill, Caboolture). Government support through First Home Owner Grant and First Home Guarantee scheme helps younger buyers enter the market with minimal deposits.

**Upgraders: 30-35%**
Families moving from units to houses, or from smaller to larger homes as families grow. Popular upgrade destinations include North Lakes, Aspley, and Redcliffe—offering space, schools, and amenity.

**Investors: 20-25%**
Targeting rental yields of 4-5% in growth suburbs. North Lakes, Caboolture, and Deception Bay popular for strong rental demand and capital growth prospects. Many investors purchasing house and land packages in new estates.

**Downsizers: 5-10%**
Empty nesters selling larger homes in established suburbs and purchasing modern low-maintenance townhouses or units in North Lakes, Redcliffe, or Chermside.

### Looking Ahead: 2025 Outlook

**Interest Rate Stability:**
With inflation moderating, the Reserve Bank is expected to hold or potentially reduce rates in 2025. Lower rates would improve borrowing capacity and support continued buyer demand.

**Continued Infrastructure:**
Ongoing North Lakes development, Caboolture hospital expansion, and Bruce Highway upgrades will continue supporting North Brisbane's appeal and price growth.

**Supply Challenges:**
Limited land releases in established suburbs will maintain price pressure. New estates provide supply, but demand from population growth and interstate migration continues outpacing new dwellings.

**Forecast:**
We expect North Brisbane growth of 4-6% in 2025—slightly moderating from 2024 but remaining solid. Growth suburbs (Mango Hill, Caboolture, Deception Bay) may continue outperforming at 6-8%.

### What This Means for Buyers

**Act Decisively:**
In a market averaging 28 days on market, pre-approval is essential. Well-priced properties receive multiple offers quickly—hesitation means missing out.

**Focus on Fundamentals:**
Buy in suburbs with strong infrastructure, employment access, and rental demand. These fundamentals support long-term capital growth regardless of short-term market fluctuations.

**Consider Growth Corridors:**
Suburbs along the rail line (Mango Hill, Petrie, Kallangur) and near employment hubs (Brendale, North Lakes) offer strongest growth prospects.
