## When to Refinance Your Home Loan: Complete Brisbane Guide

Refinancing replaces your current home loan with a new one—either with your existing lender or a different lender. Done strategically, refinancing can save thousands annually. But it's not always worthwhile. Here's when refinancing makes sense.

### Reason 1: Reduce Your Interest Rate

**The Savings Opportunity:**
Many homeowners haven't reviewed their loan in 3-5 years. Lenders rarely offer existing customers their best rates—new customers get priority pricing. Meanwhile, competitive rates have improved. You could be paying 6.5-7.0% while new borrowers access 6.09-6.29%.

**Savings Examples:**
- **$700k loan, 6.7% → 6.2%:** Save $246/month ($2,952 annually)
- **$700k loan, 6.5% → 6.0%:** Save $246/month ($2,952 annually)
- **$850k loan, 6.8% → 6.3%:** Save $357/month ($4,284 annually)

**Break-Even Analysis:**
Refinancing typically costs $500-1,500 (discharge fee, application fee, valuation). If saving $250/month, you break even in 2-6 months. Every month after is pure savings.

**When It's Worth It:**
- Current rate is 0.5%+ above best available rates
- Haven't reviewed loan in 2+ years
- Loan balance over $400k (higher balances = more savings from rate reduction)

### Reason 2: Access Equity for Renovations or Investment

**Building Equity:**
North Brisbane property growth (5-8% annually) means many homeowners have built substantial equity. If you purchased a North Lakes home for $650k three years ago, it's now worth approximately $720k. With $500k loan remaining, you have $220k equity.

**Usable Equity:**
Lenders typically allow borrowing up to 80% LVR. 80% of $720k = $576k. With $500k loan remaining, you can access $76k additional funds.

**Common Uses:**
- **Renovations:** Kitchen, bathroom, extensions ($40-80k typical)
- **Investment property deposit:** $60-100k for next investment
- **Debt consolidation:** Roll credit cards and personal loans into home loan
- **Business purposes:** Equipment, expansion, working capital
- **Major purchases:** Vehicles, education, medical expenses

**Tax Considerations:**
Interest on equity used for investment (property deposit, business) is typically tax-deductible. Interest on personal use (renovations, vehicle) is not. We help structure loans correctly for tax efficiency.

### Reason 3: Consolidate Debts

**High-Interest Debt:**
Credit cards (18-22% p.a.) and personal loans (8-15% p.a.) cost significantly more than home loan interest (6-7% p.a.). Consolidating these into your home loan saves interest.

**Example:**
- $30k credit card debt at 20% = $6,000 annual interest
- $20k personal loan at 12% = $2,400 annual interest
- Total: $8,400 annual interest

Refinance and consolidate $50k into home loan at 6.5% = $3,250 annual interest. **Save $5,150 annually.**

**Caution:**
You're converting short-term debt (2-5 year credit card/personal loan payoff) into 30-year debt. Only makes sense if you maintain discipline—make extra repayments to pay off the consolidated amount within 5 years, don't re-accumulate credit card debt.

### Reason 4: Access Better Features

**Modern Loan Features:**
Loans from 5+ years ago often lack features now standard:
- **Offset accounts:** Every dollar reduces interest charged
- **Unlimited extra repayments:** Pay off loan faster without penalty
- **Fee-free:** Modern loans often have no monthly/annual fees ($300-600 annual savings)
- **Better internet banking:** Mobile apps, easy transfers, clear interfaces
- **Portability:** Transfer loan to new property if upgrading
- **Flexible repayment schedules:** Weekly, fortnightly, or monthly

**Offset Account Value:**
With $50k in offset against $700k loan at 6.5%, you save $3,250 annually in interest. Over 10 years, that's $32,500 saved—while maintaining full access to your $50k.

### Reason 5: Switch From Fixed to Variable (or Vice Versa)

**When Fixed Period Ends:**
If you fixed 2-3 years ago, your fixed period may be ending soon. This is the perfect time to refinance—no break costs, and you can choose new rate structure.

**Strategic Switch:**
- **Fixed period ending, rates expected to fall:** Switch to variable to benefit from decreases
- **Currently variable, rates expected to rise:** Fix to protect against increases
- **Want flexibility:** Switch to variable with offset for better features

### When NOT to Refinance

**High Break Costs:**
If you're mid-fixed-term and rates have fallen since you fixed, break costs can be $5-20k. Calculate break costs and compare to potential savings. Often better to wait until fixed period ends.

**Short Remaining Term:**
If only 2-3 years remaining on loan, refinance costs may exceed total savings. Ride out existing loan.

**Poor Credit:**
If credit score has decreased since original loan (missed payments, defaults, increased debts), you may not access better rates. Review credit first.

**Planning to Sell Soon:**
If selling within 12 months, refinance costs won't be recovered through savings. Only refinance if accessing equity for specific purpose.

**Already on Competitive Rate:**
If current rate is within 0.2-0.3% of best available, savings may not justify refinance effort and cost.

### The Refinancing Process

**Step 1: Loan Review (Free)**
We analyze your current loan—rate, features, remaining term, break costs (if fixed), and costs to refinance. You'll know if refinancing makes financial sense.

**Step 2: Compare Options**
We compare 50+ lenders and present 2-3 best options with clear comparison of rates, fees, features, and total savings.

**Step 3: Application**
If proceeding, we submit application. Most refinances approve within 5-7 days (faster than purchases since you already own the property).

**Step 4: Valuation**
New lender values your property. Recent North Brisbane growth means valuations often come in higher than purchase price—improving LVR.

**Step 5: Settlement**
New lender pays out old loan and takes over security. Typically settles 4-6 weeks from application. You start saving immediately.

### Refinancing Costs to Consider

**Old Lender Costs:**
- Discharge fee: $200-400
- Break costs (if fixed): $0-20,000+ depending on circumstances

**New Lender Costs:**
- Application fee: $0-600 (many lenders waive for good borrowers)
- Valuation fee: $0-300 (often free)
- Settlement fee: $200-400

**Other Costs:**
- Conveyancing/legal: $300-800

**Total Typical Cost: $500-1,500** (excluding break costs)

### How Often Should You Review?

**Annual Reviews:**
We recommend reviewing your loan annually. Market rates change, your circumstances change, and new loan features emerge. Annual reviews ensure you remain competitive.

**Major Life Events:**
Review when:
- Income increases (can handle higher repayments, pay off faster)
- Family grows (need certainty, consider fixed rates)
- Planning renovations (access equity)
- Purchasing investment property (restructure for tax efficiency)
- Changing jobs (verify continued serviceability)

### North Brisbane Refinance Opportunities

**Equity Growth:**
North Brisbane suburbs showing 5-8% annual growth mean substantial equity building. Homeowners who purchased 3-5 years ago in North Lakes, Mango Hill, Chermside, or Aspley likely have significant accessible equity.

**Rate Competition:**
Strong North Brisbane property market means lenders compete aggressively for refinance business. Well-located properties in quality suburbs access best rates.

**Typical Scenario:**
Purchased North Lakes home for $650k in 2021, 10% deposit, loan $585k at 2.5% fixed 2 years. Fixed period ended 2023, reverted to variable at 6.8%. Current value $720k.

**Refinance Benefits:**
- Reduce rate from 6.8% to 6.2% = save $270/month
- Add offset account
- Access $50k equity for renovations (80% of $720k = $576k, minus current $560k loan = $16k accessible without LMI, or up to $50k with minimal LMI)

### Taking Action

Refinancing is one of the most effective ways to save money and optimize your financial position. Most North Brisbane homeowners haven't reviewed their loan in 3+ years—leaving thousands in savings on the table.
