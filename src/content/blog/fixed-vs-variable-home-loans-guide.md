## Fixed vs Variable Home Loans: Complete Guide for Brisbane Buyers

One of the most important decisions when taking a home loan is choosing between fixed and variable interest rates. Each has advantages and trade-offs. Understanding the differences helps you select the right structure for your situation.

### Variable Rate Home Loans

**How They Work:**
Interest rate fluctuates based on lender policies and Reserve Bank cash rate movements. When the RBA raises rates, your rate typically increases; when RBA cuts rates, your rate decreases.

**Key Features:**
- Rate changes monthly or quarterly based on market conditions
- Usually offer offset accounts (every dollar in offset reduces interest charged)
- Unlimited extra repayments without penalty
- Redraw facilities to access extra repayments
- Can refinance or pay out loan anytime without break costs

**Current Variable Rates:**
Owner-occupier: 6.09-6.79%, Investment: 6.29-7.09%

**Pros:**
✅ Benefit immediately when rates decrease
✅ Offset accounts significantly reduce interest paid
✅ Flexibility to make extra repayments and access via redraw
✅ No break costs if refinancing or selling
✅ Can switch to fixed rate if rates are trending upward

**Cons:**
❌ Repayments increase if rates rise
❌ Budgeting uncertainty (repayments change)
❌ No protection against rapid rate rises
❌ Rates typically start 0.2-0.4% higher than fixed rates

**Best For:**
- Borrowers who value flexibility over certainty
- Those with irregular income (self-employed, commission-based) who want to make extra repayments when cash flow is strong
- Borrowers expecting interest rates to fall
- Long-term homeowners who can weather rate fluctuations

### Fixed Rate Home Loans

**How They Work:**
Interest rate locked for agreed term (1-5 years, most commonly 1-3 years). Regardless of market rate movements, your rate and repayments remain constant during the fixed period.

**Key Features:**
- Rate guaranteed for fixed term (1-5 years)
- Repayments identical every month (budgeting certainty)
- Limited extra repayments ($10-30k annually, varies by lender)
- Break costs apply if refinancing, paying out early, or selling
- After fixed period ends, loan reverts to variable rate

**Current Fixed Rates:**
1-2 year fixed: 5.79-6.49%, 3-5 year fixed: 5.99-6.69%

**Pros:**
✅ Complete certainty on repayments for fixed term
✅ Protection if interest rates rise
✅ Currently 0.3-0.5% below variable rates (small discount)
✅ Easier budgeting with predictable repayments
✅ Peace of mind during volatile rate environments

**Cons:**
❌ No benefit if rates decrease
❌ Limited or no offset accounts
❌ Capped extra repayments ($10-30k annually)
❌ Break costs if refinancing or selling during fixed period (can be $5-20k)
❌ Less flexibility overall

**Best For:**
- Borrowers prioritizing certainty over flexibility
- First home buyers on tight budgets who need predictable repayments
- Those expecting interest rates to rise
- Buyers stretching borrowing capacity (fixed rates protect against unaffordable increases)

### Split Loans: Best of Both Worlds?

**How They Work:**
Divide loan between fixed and variable portions. Common splits: 50/50, 60/40, 70/30.

**Example:**
$700k loan split 50/50:
- $350k fixed at 5.89% for 2 years = $2,057/month
- $350k variable at 6.29% with offset = $2,149/month
- Total: $4,206/month

**Benefits:**
✅ Partial protection if rates rise (fixed portion unaffected)
✅ Partial benefit if rates fall (variable portion decreases)
✅ Offset account on variable portion reduces interest
✅ Can make extra repayments to variable portion
✅ Balances certainty with flexibility

**Strategy:**
Fix the portion covering essential expenses, keep the remainder variable for flexibility. If rates rise, you're partially protected; if rates fall, you partially benefit.

### Break Costs Explained

**What Are They?**
If you exit fixed loan early (refinance, sell, pay out), lenders charge break costs to compensate for their interest rate risk.

**How Calculated:**
Based on difference between your fixed rate and current wholesale rates, plus remaining fixed term. If rates have fallen since you fixed, break costs are higher.

**Example:**
Fixed $500k at 6.0% for 3 years, 18 months remaining. Current wholesale rate is 5.0%. Lender loses 1.0% annually for 18 months = approximately $7,500 break cost.

**Avoiding Break Costs:**
- Choose variable if you might sell within 3 years
- Use split loan (only fixed portion incurs break costs)
- Some lenders allow "portability" (transfer fixed loan to new property)
- Wait until fixed period ends before refinancing

### Current Market Considerations (Late 2024)

**Rate Outlook:**
RBA likely to hold rates stable through early 2025, with potential cuts mid-2025 if inflation continues moderating. This suggests:
- Variable or short-term fixed (1-2 years) positions you to benefit from potential cuts
- Long-term fixed (3-5 years) less attractive unless you prioritize certainty above all

**Current Spread:**
Fixed rates currently sit 0.3-0.5% below variable rates. This is unusual—fixed rates normally sit slightly above variable rates. The market is pricing in expected rate cuts.

**Strategic Choice:**
- **If confident rates will fall:** Choose variable to benefit immediately
- **If uncertain but want protection:** Choose 1-2 year fixed to lock in current low fixed rates, then reassess when fixed period ends
- **If budget is very tight:** Choose 2-3 year fixed for certainty and protection

### Making Your Decision

**Ask Yourself:**

**1. How long will you own this property?**
- Less than 3 years: Variable (avoid break costs)
- 3-7 years: Split or short-term fixed
- 7+ years: Variable with option to fix portions if rates trend upward

**2. How tight is your budget?**
- Very tight: Fixed (protect against unaffordable increases)
- Comfortable buffer: Variable (flexibility worth more than certainty)

**3. Do you make extra repayments?**
- Yes, regularly: Variable with offset (maximize interest savings)
- No: Fixed (extra repayment restrictions don't matter)

**4. Can you handle rate uncertainty?**
- Yes: Variable (accept fluctuations for potential savings)
- No: Fixed (sleep better with certainty)

**5. What's your interest rate outlook?**
- Expect rises: Fixed now
- Expect falls: Variable now
- Uncertain: Split (hedge both directions)

### Case Studies

**Case 1: Young couple, first home, tight budget**
**Recommendation:** 60% fixed 2 years, 40% variable with offset
**Reason:** Fixed portion protects budget, variable portion provides flexibility for future pay rises and bonuses

**Case 2: Established family, upgrading, comfortable income**
**Recommendation:** 100% variable with offset
**Reason:** Offset maximizes interest savings, flexibility for extra repayments, can weather rate fluctuations

**Case 3: Investor, multiple properties**
**Recommendation:** Variable with offset
**Reason:** Park rental income in offset to minimize tax-deductible interest while maintaining loan balance

**Case 4: Self-employed, irregular income**
**Recommendation:** Variable with offset
**Reason:** Unlimited extra repayments when income is strong, redraw if income drops

### Review Regularly

Regardless of choice, review annually:
- Are you still on a competitive rate?
- Has your situation changed (income, family, goals)?
- Should you switch from fixed to variable (or vice versa)?
- Are better loan features available elsewhere?

We review clients' loans annually to ensure they remain competitive and suited to current circumstances.
