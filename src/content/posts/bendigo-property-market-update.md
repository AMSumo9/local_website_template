## Bendigo Market Shows Strong Resilience

The Bendigo property market continues to be a top performer in regional Victoria, showing strong growth and resilience throughout 2025. As we head into 2026, here's what we're seeing.

### Key Market Drivers

* **Lifestyle Appeal:** The "work from home" trend continues to benefit Bendigo, with buyers from Melbourne seeking more space and better affordability.
* **Strong Infrastructure:** Significant investments in local health, education, and transport are making Bendigo an even more attractive place to live.
* **Rental Demand:** Rental yields remain high as vacancy rates stay low, drawing strong interest from property investors.

### What This Means For You

**For Buyers:** Competition is still strong for A-grade properties. It is essential to have your financing sorted with a pre-approval *before* you make an offer.

**For Sellers:** With high demand, it's a great time to sell. However, styling your home and pricing it correctly are still key to achieving a top result.
