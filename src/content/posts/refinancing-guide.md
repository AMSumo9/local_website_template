## Is Your Home Loan Still Working For You?

Many Australians set up their home loan and forget about it for years. But the lending market is always changing, and the great rate you got three years ago might be costing you thousands today.

Refinancing is the process of replacing your existing home loan with a new one, either with your current lender or a new one.

### Top Reasons to Refinance

1.  **Get a Lower Interest Rate:** This is the most common reason. A lower rate can significantly reduce your monthly repayments and the total interest paid over the life of the loan.
2.  **Consolidate Debt:** You can roll high-interest debts (like credit cards or personal loans) into your mortgage to get one, lower-rate monthly payment.
3.  **Unlock Equity:** You can access the equity in your home to fund renovations, buy an investment property, or pay for a large expense.
4.  **Get Better Features:** You might want a loan with an offset account, flexible repayment options, or a line of credit.
