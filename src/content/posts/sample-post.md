## Introduction

Buying your first home is exciting, but the Bendigo market can be tricky. As local finance brokers, we've seen many buyers make the same avoidable mistakes. Here are the top 5 to watch out for.

### 1. Not Getting Pre-Approval

Walking into an open home without loan pre-approval is a recipe for disappointment. You don't know your real budget, and sellers won't take your offer seriously.

### 2. Underestimating the Costs

The purchase price is just the beginning. You also need to budget for:

* Stamp Duty
* Lender's Mortgage Insurance (LMI)
* Conveyancing and legal fees
* Building and pest inspections

### 3. Choosing the Wrong Loan

Going straight to your bank means you only see their products. A broker can compare dozens of lenders to find a loan with the features and interest rate that truly suit your long-term goals.

### 4. Ignoring Government Grants

There are several state and federal grants available for first-home buyers, like the First Home Owner Grant (FHOG) and the First Home Guarantee. Forgetting to check your eligibility is leaving free money on the table.

### 5. Rushing the Process

FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) is real. Rushing into a purchase without proper due diligence on the property or the neighbourhood can lead to buyer's remorse.
